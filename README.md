# PPModem
A Java Modem to send data over a GSM Phone. This is just experimental code. I'm interested in playing with the modem. Not the crypto, and other layers.

The JackPair pulse modem is a newer version. The translation to Java was pretty straight forward. None of the 32-bit based design was necessary, so I used integers and bytes. Indexes were used instead of pointers.
